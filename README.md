# [barebones](http://barebones.io)

Barebones is the starting point for stylesheets.

### What you get
In this project you'll find a great starting point for writing clean, functional stylesheets using scss.

I've been working on this project since 2012, so it's had a lot of trail, error, and experimentation go into it.

The primary source of magic is in the `utilities` file, so I recommend you have a look through.

I've noted the primary features in the [wiki](https://github.com/nothingrandom/barebonesio/wiki/What's-included).

### Wishlist (and issues)
Any features you'd like to see? Any features don't work for you? Let me know with the issue tracker.

### Recommendations
I suggest that you use this project alongside of [blendid](https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid). Older users of barebones will remember that it once came with a full gulp setup. I was struggling to keep up with best practices and new tools, and found myself using Vue / React Starter where there was too much bulk here.

I also recommend that you use this [scss-lint](https://github.com/nothingrandom/scss-lint-default.yml) config.
